# Glowry

## Idea description
Glowry is a skincare-focused web application that helps users manage and personalize their skincare journey. The app allows users to create skin profiles, build step-by-step skincare routines, and write reviews for skincare products retrieved from a free third-party API, including detailed ingredient information. In addition, users can read and publish skincare articles to learn more about effective skincare practices. By combining personalized profiles, routine planning, and real product data, Glowry supports informed and mindful skincare decisions through a simple and user-friendly platform.
